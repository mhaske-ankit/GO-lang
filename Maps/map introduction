Maps:

Maps are like a dictionary where you look up words to find their meanings.
In Go, you use maps when you have pairs of things that go together, like a name and a phone number.
Think of a map as a box where you can put stuff in and find it quickly by its label.


Maps help you find things quickly by their names.
